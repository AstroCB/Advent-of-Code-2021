Another year of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com); code quality not guaranteed.

Didn't make it through the month [last year](https://github.com/AstroCB/Advent-of-Code-2020) switching to a new language every day, so the goal this year is to use whatever feels natural and get through the whole thing.
